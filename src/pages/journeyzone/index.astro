    <h1>Welcome to the Viking Era JourneyZone!</h1>
    <h2>What is JourneyZone?</h2>
    <p>JourneyZone is our annual trip exclusively for speakers just after the JavaZone conference. 
    This year we will not be traveling far geographically, but the Journey will take us far back in time.</p>

    <h2>When? Where?</h2>
    <p>We are leaving Oslo early in the morning Friday (the day after JavaZone) September 6th. We will be back in Oslo (Central station) in the afternoon on Sunday, September 8th. We will travel by bus for around an hour from Oslo.</p>
    <p>The entire trip is planned, so all you need to do is meet up. You will need your outdoor equipment for hiking. We will send a more detailed packing list closer to the event.</p>

    <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
    <p>All speakers of JavaZone are invited, but we have a limited number of spots available for the journey. Those who hold full presentations and workshops are prioritized, but presenters of lightning talks are of course also welcome to apply!</p>
    <p>In order to attend, you must be in a physical condition that allows you to hike up a mountain and spend the whole day out in the wilderness. No extraordinary physical activity is required by participants.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal expenses</h2>
    <p>JavaZone will cover almost all your expenses which is considered your reward for holding your talk at the conference. To ensure that we stretch the budget to accommodate as many as possible we require that all attendees pay NOK 1500.</p>

    <h2>The program</h2>
    <p>The program is, as usual, tightly packed and full of interesting events. The main activities are hiking and doing various activities outside, so good shoes and hiking gear and clothes are absolutely necessary. We may end up camping in the nature. 
        The details will be a surprise and could change depending on the weather conditions. We will adapt to whatever comes our way and set up a great program accordingly.</p>
